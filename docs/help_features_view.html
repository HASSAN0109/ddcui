    <h3>Features View (2)</h3>
    <body>
        The <strong>Features</strong> view has the following columns:
        <ul> 
           <li>Feature code - A one byte hexadecimal number </li>
           <li>Feature name - Can vary depending on the version of the Monitor Control Command Specification that the monitor 
                        implements.</li>
           <li><strong>RW, RO, WO</strong> - Indicates if the feature can be read and/or written. </li>
           <li>Type field. - <strong>C</strong> for "continuous" features, and <strong>NC</strong> for "non-continuous".  Continuous features can take any of range of values
                            up to some maximum value, for example feature x10 brightness typically takes values in the range 0..100 or the range 0.255. Simple Non-continous features are can take one of a limited set of values, for example x60 Input Source.  Complex Non-Continuous features, 
                            those that have feature-specific definitions, e.g. x9c Display Firmware Level, or xd9 VCP Version.
                            These features are almost always <strong>RO</strong>.  As the MCCS specification has evolved,
                            <strong>NC</strong> has become a grab-bag for features that are not clearly caterorizable as Continuous or Non-Continuous.
                        </li>
           <li> Feature Value - The form of the feature value field depends on the feature.  Modifyable Continous features have a slider and spin box, either of which can be used to change the value. Modifyable  simple Non-Continuous features typically have a drop down combo box showing the possible values. 
           Features in the range xE0..xFF are reserved for manufacturer use.  As <strong>ddcui</strong> does not know how to 
           interpret them, it simply allows for editing the individual bytes of the value.
           </li>
       </ul>
