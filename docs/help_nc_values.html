        <h3>Non-Continuous Feature Values</h3>
<h4>Source of Non-Continuous Feature Values</h4>
<p>
This option indicates the source of the values shown in the combo box for 
simple Non-Continuous (NC) features. There are two sources for the value codes. 
Each has advantages and disadvantages.
The choices are:
<ul>
<li> <strong>Monitor Control Command Set</strong> - The VESA Monitor Control Command Set 
specification (MCCS) lists valid values for simple Non-Continuous (NC) features, along with their names.
<p>
The advantage of this source is completeness.  
Valid values can vary by MCCS version, and <strong>ddcui</strong> takes this into account.
The disadvantage is that the list of values for a feature may well include values that do 
not apply to the particular monitor.  
Also, the monitor may implement additional manufacturer specific values.
<li><strong>Capabilites String</strong> 
- The capabilities string reported by the monitor indicates the allowed values for simple 
Non-Continuous features.  
If this option is chosen, the values are those listed in the string. 
Unfortunately, the capabilities string is sometimes wrong.  
The capabilities string lists only hex numbers for allowed feature values. The names of values 
come from MCCS.
<li><strong>Both MCCS and Capabilities</strong> 
- The values shown are the union of those in the MCCS specification and those in the capabilities string.
</ul>
<h4>Use latest MCCS values</h4>
<p>
    The defined NC values for a feature can vary by MCCS version.  Typically, values are added with each version. 
    Sometimes the names associated with values change.  Normally, <strong>ddcui</strong> uses NC values and names from 
    the MCCS version corresponding to the Virtual Control Panel (VCP) version of the monitor. 
    Sometimes, a monitor implements values that are found in a later version of the spec than indicated by its VCP version. 
    If this box is checked, the values and names are taken from the most recent MCCS spec for which
    the feature is defined, typically 2.2.
