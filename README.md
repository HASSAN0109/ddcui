# ddcui - A graphical user interface for ddcutil

This is an early alpha version of **ddcui**.  

It is only available from github, and must be built from source.
Persons building **ddcui** should be familiar with building C++ Qt applications.
There are currently no pre-built packages (e.g. dpkg or rpm). 

**ddcui** has as yet been tested on a limited number of platforms.  Issues will undoubtedly arise 
due to variations in Linux distribution, desktop environment, Qt version, and specific monitors.
In particular, I would expect to see formatting and layout issues, and problems arising from Qt 
configuration.

For basic instructions on building **ddcui**, see file BUILDING.md.
